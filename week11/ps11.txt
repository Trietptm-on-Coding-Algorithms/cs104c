Submission:

- Submit a single file containing your solution to the problem. It should
output only the answer requested (NO DEBUG OUTPUT).

Grading:

20% - Code Quality

Description:

You are given an array A with N integers, and M queries. Each query is of one
of two types:

1. Change the ith element of A to x.
2. Get the greatest common divisor of A[l], A[l + 1], ..., A[r - 1], A[r] (that
is, the GCD of A[i] for all i in [l, r]).

For each query of type 2, print the result of the query.

Rules:

Each input file will begin with a single integer T representing the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case will contain two space-separated integers N
and M. The second line contains N space-separated integers, the initial
elements of A. Following this are M lines, each describing a single query.

Each query will be of type 1 or 2, as described in the problem statement.
Queries of type 1 look like "1 i x", and queries of type 2 look like "2 l r".
All indices (i, l, r) are 1-indexed.

Output:

For each test case, print a single line of output containing the answers to
the queries of type 2, separated by spaces. Trailing spaces will be ignored.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= M <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= initial array element values <= 10^9
1 <= i <= N
1 <= x <= 10^9
1 <= l <= r <= N

Input (read from standard in):
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 5
2 4 4
1 4 3
1 2 3
2 2 4

Output (print to standard out):
1 4 3

Queries 1 and 2 deal with the original array. The GCD of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 1,
and the GCD of [4] is 4. Queries 3 and 4 change the array to [1, 3, 3, 3, 5].
Query 5 gets the GCD of [3, 3, 3], which is 3.
