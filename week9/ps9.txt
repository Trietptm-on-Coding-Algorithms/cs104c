Description:

You are soon going to be one of the first contestants on a new game show called "How Many Factors?". The format of the show is as follows: in each round, the host gives the contestants a positive integer N. Contestants must hit a button and say the sum of the numbers of distinct prime factors of all the positive integers less than or equal to N. (Note that 1 has 0 prime factors, and a prime number has a single prime factor.)

You are not a very moral person, so you've decided to write a program to help you cheat.

Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case has a single line with a single integer, N.

Output:

For each test case, print a single line of output containing a single integer, the sum of the numbers of distinct prime factors of all the positive integers less than or equal to N.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 5 * 10^6

Sample Input (read from standard in):

2
1
10

Sample Output (print to standard out):

0
11

Explanation:

In the first round, N is 1. The only positive integer less than or equal to 1 is 1, and 1 has zero prime factors.

In the second round, N is 10. Here are the distinct prime factors for each positive integer less than or equal to 10:

1:  {}
2:  {2}
3:  {3}
4:  {2}
5:  {5}
6:  {2, 3}
7:  {7}
8:  {2}
9:  {3}
10: {2, 5}

So 1 has 0 distinct prime factors; 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have 1; and 6 and 10 have 2. The sum is 11.
