Description:

As a cashier, you often need to make change. But this is kind of a mindless activity (the computer tells you the best way to make change for a given amount), so you get bored. One day, you start to wonder how many ways you could make change for a particular amount.

A "way of making change" is a sequence C_1, C_2, ..., C_N, where C_i identifies the ith coin type given to the customer. Note that, for example, giving the customer a nickel followed by a dime is different than giving the customer a dime followed by a nickel: order matters! Note also that coin types can be repeated. So, to make 25 cents in change, you could give the customer five pennies, then a dime, and finally two nickels.

You have an unlimited number of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents). Given an amount X (in cents), how many ways are there to make change for that amount? Since your answer may be large, print the remainder when your answer is divided by 10^9 + 7.

Input:

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing a single integer, X, the amount (in cents) for which you want to make change.

Output:

For each test case, print a single line of output containing the number of ways to make change for X. Since your answer may be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Hint:

Be careful when using the modulo operator! At every step of your computation, try to keep all your numbers reduced modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 40
0 <= X <= 1000

Sample output (write to standard out):

9

Explanation:

There is only one way to make change for 1 cent: a single penny.

There is only one way to make change for 4 cents: four pennies.

There are nine ways to make change for 10 cents: a dime; two nickels; ten pennies; or any of the 6 orderings of a nickel and five pennies.
