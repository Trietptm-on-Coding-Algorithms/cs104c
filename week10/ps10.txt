Description:

You have an infinitely sized pegboard. Here is a finitely sized one,
http://goo.gl/bqlx5R. A pegboard has a hole at every lattice point.

You decide to put N pegs in various holes of the pegboard. If you put a single
rubber band around all of the pegs, which pegs would touch the rubber band?

No 3 pegs on the pegboard are collinear.

Rules:

Each input file will begin with a single integer T representing the number of
test cases. For each test case, the first line will contain a single integer N,
the number of pegs. The following N lines will have pairs of integers i and j,
representing the coordinates of the peg.

Output:

For each test case, print the 0-based indices of the pegs touching the board in
sorted order.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^6
-10^6 <= i, j <= 10^6

Input (read from standard in):
2
3
0 0
1 1
0 1
5
-2 -2
-2 2
0 1
2 -2
2 2

Output (print to standard out):
0 1 2
0 1 3 4

In the second case, the peg at (0, 1) is not touched by the rubber band.
