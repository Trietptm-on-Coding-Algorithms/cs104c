Description:

It's a rough time to be a jewel thief. You're planning to break into this
jewelry store, but as always, your burlap sack is limited in how much weight it
can carry. Each jewel has a weight and a value, and your sack cannot carry more
weight than its capacity. You want to maximize the amount of value you can carry
out of the jewelry store.

Luckily, your henchmen in the R&D lab have been working on a pair of devices.
The first is a cloner, which makes a perfect copy of any jewel. The second is a
splitter, which can cut any jewel into any real valued size. Using one or both
of these tools, what is the maximum value you can steal from the store?

Input:

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

Each test case begins with two integers N and C, the number of jewels and the capacity of your sack.
N lines follow, each containing two space separated integers V_i and W_i, the value and weight of the
jewel.

Output:

For each test case, print a single line of output containing four space separated integers.
1. The first integer is the maximum value you can steal without using any tools
2. The second integer is the maximum value you can steal using only the cloner
3. The third integer is the maximum value you can steal using only the laser cutter
4. The fourth integer is the maximum value you can steal using both the cloner and laser cutter

If any of these values are decimals, print them rounded to 2 decimal places.
Use the printf operator in Java or C++ to do this easily.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 40
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= C <= 1000
1 <= V_i <= 10000
1 <= W_i <= 10000

Sample input (read from standard in):

1
4 10
10 5
40 4
30 6
50 3

Sample output (write to standard out):

2
10
5
16.6

90 150 105.00 166.67

Explanation:

Take jewels 2 and 4.
If you can clone, clone jewel 4 3 times.
If you can cut, take jewel 2 and 4, and cut 3 in half and take that.
If you can cut and clone, fill your bag with jewel 4.
